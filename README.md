# KalkSpace Getr√§nkekasse Tablet Setup

We are using an Armbian/Ubuntu Jammy based setup

## Preparation

Install Armbian as described in their documentation.
After installing you should be able to ssh using root to the machine

## Install kiosk

Adjust the IP in `inventory.ini`. Be sure to check public_hostname.
For local development use "localhost". Otherwise "getraenkekasse.kalk.space".

`ansible-playbook tablet.yml -v -i inventory.ini --ask-pass -K`

## Post work

Finally once the kiosk is running, attach a keyboard, hit ctrl-+ a few times so zoom level is ok

(should be automated)
